This script had generated for test purposes of finding HIGH severity vulnerabilities based on CVSSv3.

Python request library used to take page content and beautifulsoup4 used for parsing page content. 
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing stores cve details by years and months

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing/2022/2 page includes all CVE IDs for requested month

1. Calculate last 3 months and generate full-listing urls
2. Get CVE lists and store all cves in a list
3. Every single CVE request CVE detail page (e.g https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3534) convert page data to beautifulsoup object.
Check severity, If severity equals to HIGH store cve details to a temporary dictionary. 
Set variables, cve-id, score, title, summary
4. Add temporary dictionary to a list for sort and save a log file.
5. Repeat and complete this process for every single cve id
6. Sort dictionary list by score
7. Write sorted list to a file

ThreadPoolExecutor added to code, it is much more faster.
